		<h2>About the Site</h2>
		<p>This website is dedicated to my favorite non-electronic game, which is Dungeons and Dragons. I created this site as a showcase of my skills as a developer, and also to share my love for this game with others. I hope you enjoy exploring the site and learning more about the game.</p>

		<h2>About the Creator</h2>
		<p>My name is Jaaved Dewan, and I'm a student at Seneca College taking Computer Programming Analysis. 
            I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons during the pandemic, and it has been a favorite pastime of mine ever since. 
            I find this game to be really fun, unpredicatable and a great way to relax with your friends.

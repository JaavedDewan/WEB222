      Masayoshi Soken is a highly accomplished Japanese video game composer and sound editor known for his work with Square Enix since <time>2001</time>. Born on <time datetime="1975-01-10">January 10, 1975</time>, in La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico, Soken later moved to Tokyo with his family, where he attended the Tokyo University of Science, majoring in chemistry. Despite his background in science, Soken&#39;s passion for music began at a young age, with his father being a professional trumpet player and his mother a piano teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing his education, Soken was hired as a sound editor and designer at Konami, where he worked before joining Square in <time>1998</time>. His early work at the company focused primarily on sound effect design, rather than composition. However, he quickly demonstrated his musical talents and was given the opportunity to compose and arrange scores for several video games, including <em>Nichibeikan Pro Baseball&#58; Final League</em> and <em>World Fantasista</em>. His current most prominent instruments are the piano, trumpet and more recently, the guitar and Otamatone.

      Soken&#39;s first set of jobs were <q>on small and mid-sized titles...unusual for the Square Enix brand, but it was so much fun</q> (<cite><a href="http://www.vgmonline.net/masayoshisokeninterview/">Masayoshi Soken Interview: From Astral to Umbral</a></cite>). His first major project with Square Enix was <em>Drakengard 2</em> and <em>Front Mission 5&#58; Scars of the War</em>, both released in 2005. The following year, he composed and arranged the score for <em>Mario Hoops 3-on-3</em>. Soken then worked with Kenji Ito and Tsuyoshi Sekito on the soundtrack to <em>Dawn of Mana</em>, with Academy Award-winning composer Ryuichi Sakamoto providing the main theme. In 2007, he scored the online game <em>Elebest</em> with Ai Yamashita.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soken&#39;s work with Square Enix has also extended to their advertisements, with him creating the fanfare for Square Enix Music TV, a monthly video feature where new album releases are discussed, and interviews with Square Enix composers are conducted. He also composed the sports commercial song &#34;<em>Blue Stream</em>&#34; for <em>Front Mission 5&#58; Scars of the War</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the <time>2010</time> development team reshuffling, Soken has been the sound director for <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> (<abbr title="Final Fantasy XIV">FFXIV</abbr>), and he became the primary composer for the title with the launch of <em>A Realm Reborn</em> and its subsequent expansions. Soken formed a rock band called <em>The Primals</em> with members of the sound team to play at <abbr title="Final Fantasy XIV">FFXIV</abbr> events such as Fan Festival. <em>The Primals</em> have since released several albums, starting with <em><abbr title="Final Fantasy XIV">FFXIV</abbr>&#58; From Astral to Umbral</em>. In addition to all his leadership, Soken has also personally created various musical pieces for its updates, elevating the soundtrack to a higher level <q cite="http://www.vgmonline.net/masayoshisoken/">with several epic battle themes and beautiful setting tracks</q>.

        <em>&#34;For the next ten years I actually didn&#39;t compose many songs at all,&#34; he continues. &#34;I was instead creating sound effects for various games. That work was important for my formation...that experience of figuring out how to match sound with very specific gameplay moments built a foundation of understanding how to match game content with sound and music content, which is an important skill.&#34;</em>

      Soken&#39;s music style focuses on the player&#39;s experience, with his passion for music being driven by his desire to enhance the gaming experience for players. When tasked with arranging Final Fantasy music originally composed by Nobuo Uematsu, Soken takes extra care to achieve this goal. He primarily composes using piano and keyboard but prefers playing guitar in live performances.

    <p>
      In May 2021, Soken revealed during the <abbr title="Final Fantasy XIV">FFXIV</abbr> Digital Fan Festival that he had been receiving chemotherapy for cancer treatment throughout most of 2020 but was now in remission. He kept his treatment hidden from most of the development team, doing some of his work for <abbr title="Final Fantasy XIV">FFXIV</abbr> from the hospital but also found it <q>mentally as well as physically tough</q> (<cite><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/final-fantasy-xiv-composer-masayoshi-soken-reveals-cancer-diagnosis-2942462">&#39;Final Fantasy XIV&#39; composer Masayoshi Soken reveals cancer battle</a></cite>). Despite his illness, Soken continued to work on the game's music, as he felt it was his responsibility to complete the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      In September 2020, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy XVI (<strong><dfn title= "Final Fantasy XVI">FFXVI</dfn></strong>) was in development for PlayStation 5, with Soken being the lead composer for the game. This announcement was made official in June 2022, with further details about the game being revealed, including Soken&#39;s contributions to the soundtrack.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of early 2023, Soken continues to work as the sound director and primary composer for <abbr title="Final Fantasy XIV">FFXIV</abbr>, as well as the lead composer for <abbr title="Final Fantasy XVI">FFXVI</abbr>. He has received numerous accolades for his work, including nominations for the Game Audio Network Guild Awards, the Golden Reel Award in <time>2020</time> and winning the award for Best Score &#45; Video Game at the Hollywood Music in Media Awards in <time>2019</time>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, Masayoshi Soken's passion for music and dedication to enhancing the gaming experience for players has led him to become a highly accomplished video game composer and sound editor. From his early work at Konami to his current role as sound director and primary composer for <abbr title="Final Fantasy XIV">FFXIV</abbr>, Soken has consistently demonstrated his musical talents and ability to create memorable and immersive scores for video games.
